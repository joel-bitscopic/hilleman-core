# hilleman-core
.NET Core Library &amp; REST Services for VistA EHR Platform

Hilleman makes use of the swagger library for creating web service API test pages. 
Run the project and navigate to http://localhost:5000/swagger (if it doesn't 
launch on it's own) to view the list of available APIs

The hilleman.sqlite database contains the configs. "SourceSystemTable" contains all 
the VistA - update it (it's a SourceSystemTable serialized as JSON) with your
VistA system's RPC broker connection details
